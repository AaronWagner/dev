# You Don't Like Programming #
(In-Progress)

If you ever say that you do like programming, then you don't really understand yourself.

You don't like programming, you like:
- Solving problems
- Creating new things
- Feeling like a wizard because you can do/automate tasks that may be impossible for "regular" people to do (TODO: Add link)

Programming and working with code is just one medium for all of this. And, it just so happens to be one that you are pretty good at.

Is any of this information useful for you? I don't know, but at least you may understand yourself better. Don't forget why you are doing something. If I were more bold, then I would say this article would help you in your career aspects and help prevent burnouts (and help you on the career path that is right for you).

If you think this article may be helpful for others also, then please share it. Also, add your comments below and I will update this post to be more useful for all the developers out there.
